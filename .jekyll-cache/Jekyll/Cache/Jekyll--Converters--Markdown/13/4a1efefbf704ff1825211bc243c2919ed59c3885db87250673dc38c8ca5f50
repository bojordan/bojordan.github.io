I"!<p>I spare moments I’ve stumbling through getting a quick blogging solution, and - HELLO WORLD - I have one.</p>

<p>GitHub is a wonderful resource, and I already use it. Further, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages">GitHub Pages</a> is a wonderful <em>free</em> resource for all users of GitHub, both free and paid. Add the ability fork someone else’s getting-started work (of course this is a core tenent of what GitHub is), is amazing.</p>

<h2 id="the-steps">The steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Get a GitHub account, if you don’t already have one.</li>
  <li>Fork <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">Barry Clark’s jekyll-now repo</a>.</li>
  <li>Rename your fork’s repository to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;yourgithubname&gt;.github.io</code>.</li>
  <li>Done!</li>
</ol>

<p>What you end up with is a static site. This basically means there is no database needed to run things. GitHub provides Jekyll (the code that generates the static pages) as a service. All of my content are <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> text files, which are versioned with Git.</p>

<p>If you are intersted in the same, please check out Barry Clark’s extremely helpful repo and explanations:</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Private repo</strong>: I don’t believe you can take a forked repo private, so may do a tiny amount of work to make this blog’s repo private. (Note, I believe GitHub Pages is only supported in private repos wih paid GitHub accounts.) I may prefer the repo to remain public.</li>
  <li><strong>Style</strong>: I’d like to style things a little. I’ve already added an excerpt separator to the site’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>, but I haven’t bothered to look at themes.</li>
  <li><strong>Custom domain</strong>: I am using a custom domain for this site. Getting this to work was mostly simple, but I had more hiccups than I expected.</li>
  <li><strong>Run Jekyll locally</strong>: I need to run the site locally.</li>
  <li><strong>Drafts</strong>: I need a drafts strategy, which is <a href="http://seanlaw.github.io/2015/03/14/jekyll-drafts/">probably this</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-long-term">What’s long-term?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>DasBlog Core</strong>: I have no interest in working on the Jekyll back-end of this solution. If I find things are limiting in any way (not likely), I’m interested in looking into a .NET-centric static site-generating solution like <a href="https://github.com/poppastring/dasblog-core">DasBlog Core</a>. <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/migrating-this-blog-to-azure-its-done-now-the-work-begins">Scott Hanselman has a great post about his implementation.</a></li>
</ul>

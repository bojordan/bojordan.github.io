title: Keyboard play, part 2
---

First, I tried the [Keychron Q1](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q1). I got one with a knob, which I like to use to control volume on my Mac, and which I dislike since the knob is in a key-shaped hole in the top case.

When I am programming (especially on Windows), I find I'm a heavy user of Home/End keys, and I find the traditional tenkeyless 85% keyboard more comfortable. Enter the [Keychron Q3](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q3-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard). No knob on this one.

I'm eager to experiment with a split keyboard for the first time in many years, now that Keychron has [an Alice layout keyboard with function keys](https://www.keychron.com/pages/keychron-q10-customizable-mechanical-keyboard). It also has a knob with a proper circular case hole.

My switches sweet spot is Gazzew Boba U4T switches. I prefer lighter springs. I also love tall key caps, and find the Drop MT3 keycaps to be the perfect shape. They come in ABS and in PBT, but I vastly prefer rougher feel of the PBT. The [9009](https://drop.com/buy/mt3-9009-pbt-keycap-set?defaultSelectionIds=968777) and the [2048](https://drop.com/buy/drop-biip-mt3-extended-custom-keycap-set?defaultSelectionIds=969821) are on my Q3 and Q1, respectively.
